      <div class="content">
        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>The client presented a problem statement with three distinct components: communication strategy, program evaluation and technical capacity. While interrelated, our team had to separate and breakdown each concern and to envision possible solutions in order to narrow our problem space and set expectations. Prior to departure, my team and I had weekly calls with key client management to familiarize ourselves with the organization, expectations and other logistics. These weekly calls gave our team more information to contextualize the problem, but we wouldn't really understand the client's problem without being on site.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>There was only so much information that our pre-departure calls could generate. Thus, our team's first goal upon arrival in Cape Town was to conduct forms of contextual inquiry and other qualitative research to assess the client's needs, as opposed to wants.</p>
        <div class="indent">
        <h3>Observations & Interviews</h3>
        <p>Our team met with and observed other key staff members in order to see how their day-to-day work flow looked like. We also conducted formal and informal interviews asking them about why they performed a particular function or to explain their thoughts if they had a visceral, positive or negative reaction.</p>
        <p>Our team also had the opportunity to observe the client conduct trainings at two primary schools, rural outreach at two clinics and an annual fundraising event with a local sports team. Observing the client interact with external stakeholders gave us much richer data to incorporate into our research. </p>

        <h3>Focus Groups</h3>
        <p>Our team conducted four different focus groups with staff, current and former clients and their caregivers. We prepared several research questions, a script and a series of questions prior to each focus group. The focus groups ranged from 6 to 10 individuals in size and were conducted by two members of the team, an interviewer and a note taker. With the consent of group members, we also took an audio recording of the session for later transcription and coding.</p>

        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <p>For each outreach event, our team asked attendees to fill out short pre- and post-event questionnaires that assessed attendees’ general awareness of visual impairments and knowledge of the client and its available services.</p>

        <h2>Refining our problem statement</h2>
        <p>Based on conversations, interviews and other qualitative methods, our team came together to synthesize our data, identify themes and generate findings. We identified that an effective communication strategy requires a shared staff understanding of what and how that looks like. Unless there was a common understanding of the value of the organization's history and impact, any communication materials we could produce would unlikely be cohesive and sustainable. We also identified that effective program evaluation could generate useful data that could improve operational efficiency as well as create a more powerful and compelling story to tell. Thus, we refined our problem statement to tackle particular <em>processes</em> in addition to producing content.</p>

        <h2>Prototypes & Iteration</h2>
        <p>Based on our preliminary findings and due to time constraints, our team created working drafts of communication strategies, processes and materials, with a goal of revising them on a weekly basis. We tested them in real time, incorporating them into the client's day-to-day operations and communications with external stakeholders. We wanted to see how staff and external stakeholders would react and to troubleshoot any problems as they happen.</p>
        <p>As we deployed new communication materials, our team conducted two four hour workshops with key staff with a twofold goal: to elicit feedback on our test strategies and to create a stronger sense of shared purpose and mission. We asked staff to identify individual and departmental strengths and how they compelling narratives that would better connect with community at large.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Based on a series of observations, interviews, focus groups, meetings and workshops, our team presented a series of recommendations and deliverables that addressed the client’s goals, which spanned communications strategy, program evaluation and technical capacity. Our physical deliverables included letterhead, brochures, flyers and reports. We recommended certain process changes.</p>

        <p>I had the fortune of extending my stay in Cape Town for another month. I continued to work with the client on a part-time basis, working primarily on co-writing, editing and designing the client's annual report and first ever impact report, which they continue to use today with prospective clients, funders and community members.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>There were certain limitations we had to keep in mind during the course of the project. While LOFOB has nearly 85 years of providing services to the blind and visually impaired, like many NGOs, it was also understaffed and underfunded. Many responsibilities were traditionally separated into silos, with each staff person responsible for his or her own portfolio. The organization was primarily paper-based, which made certain tasks such as intake and updating client files time consuming. We also had to consider the accessibility of tools for staff, who also had their own personal working styles.</p>
