        <h2>Discovery</h2>
        <p>Our team's first goal was to review and revise our client's problem statement. Prior to departure, my team and I had weekly calls with the client to familiarize ourselves with the organization, expectations and work flow. While these calls gave our team more information to contextualize the problem, we wouldn't be able to really understand the client's problem without examining current context and practices.</p>

        <h2>Our problem and objective</h2>
        <p>Based on these conversations, our team came up with some overarching questions that helped narrow our scope.</p>

        <div class="indent">
        <p>How can we leverage an organization’s 85-year-old history to improve communications, engagement and evaluation with clients, their families and caregivers, funders and other external stakeholders?</p>
        <p>How can we add value to and improve upon existing processes given organizational, resource and other constraints?</p>

        <p>There was only so much information and context that our pre-departure calls could generate.

        <div class="indent">
        <h3>Observations & Interviews</h3>
        <p>Our team met with and observed other key staff members in order to see how their day-to-day work flow looked like. We also conducted formal and informal interviews to uncover and contextualize their problems </p>
        <p>Our team also had the opportunity to observe LOFOB conduct trainings at two primary schools, rural outreach at two clinics and an annual fundraising event with a local sports team and a new corporate sponsor. We saw the client interact with its external stakeholders, which gave us the opportunity to identify key areas where we could add more value. Our team asked attendees to fill out short pre- and post-event questionnaires that assessed attendees’ general awareness of visual impairments and knowledge of the client and its available services.</p>

        <h3>Focus Groups</h3>
        <p>Our team conducted four different focus groups with staff, current and former clients and their caregivers. We prepared several research questions, a script and a series of questions prior to each focus group. The focus groups ranged from 6 to 10 individuals in size and were conducted by two members of my team, an interviewer and a note taker. With the consent of group members, we also took an audio recording of the session for later transcription and coding.</p>

        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <p>Our client rarely used any form of surveys to gauge the effectiveness of  Our team conducted extensive background research once we arrived on site. Our research plan consisted of several parts.</p>

        <h2>Prototypes & Iteration</h2>
        <p>Based on our preliminary findings, our team set to create working drafts of communication strategies, processes and materials, with a goal of revising them on a weekly basis. We then tested the deliverables in real time, incorporating them into LOFOB’s day-to-day operations. We wanted to see how staff and external stakeholders would react.</p>
        <p>As we deployed new communication materials, our team conducted two four hour workshops with key staff with a twofold goal: to elicit feedback on our initial deliverables and to create a stronger sense of shared purpose and mission. We asked staff to identify what they thought were key LOFOB strengths and how they can could overlap with other departments to create compelling narratives that would better connect with community at large. Based on this new consensus, our team further refined our recommendations.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>There were certain limitations we had to keep in mind during the course of the project. While LOFOB has nearly 85 years of providing services to the blind and visually impaired, like many NGOs, it was also understaffed and underfunded. Many responsibilities were traditionally separated into silos, with each staff person responsible for his or her own portfolio. The organization was primarily paper-based, which made certain tasks such as intake and updating client files time consuming. We also had to consider the accessibility of tools for staff, who also had their own needs.</p>
