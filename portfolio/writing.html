          <p class="date">November 24, 2015</p>
          <p>The Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a remnant of the Korean War that bisects the peninsula into North Korea and South Korea. Created after the armistice agreement was signed in 1953, the DMZ itself is a 2 km buffer zone on both sides of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), a line that stretches 160 miles (250 km) across the country along the 38th parallel. Despite its name, the DMZ is the most heavily militarized border in the world.</p>
